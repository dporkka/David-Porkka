Originally a biology researcher, I changed my career focus to web development after realizing I was having more fun moving pixels than petri dishes. Over the last three years I’ve designed and built a wide variety of websites for both myself, and businesses of all sizes. I find it very rewarding to help people with their digital needs. I also enjoy learning about and applying new technology. 

When I’m not in front of a computer, I can be found exploring local coffee shops, playing the piano, lifting weights, and taking blurry photos.
